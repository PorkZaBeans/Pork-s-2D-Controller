The bee artwork in this project was not developed by Brighten Up Studios. It was developed by Kenney.nl and you can find the full pack here: http://opengameart.org/content/platformer-art-complete-pack-often-updated
By developing this pack, i did not mean to distribute this artwork as my own.
The spaceship featured in this pack also does not belong to me, the rightfull owner can be found in:
